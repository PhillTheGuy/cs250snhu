The way I interpret user needs is via user stories with user stories i can discribe the function need from the code that is needed to be done. it alows you to discribe how the search needs to work or how sliders and buttons need to function for the project.
When approaching development I plan to incorporate the clean as you go stratagy so that when i am done adding what i have added it will still be clean and consice for the others working on the same project.
A good team member always looks for assistence when ever they really need it. The come to meetings and throw ideas for the project and ofcorse they make sure that code is clean for everyone to read.
